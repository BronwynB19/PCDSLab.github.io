# Design and Implementation
This site was forked from Dr. Allan Drummond’s lab website [Dammond Lab], which in turn took a great deal of inspiration from Dr. Travis Bedford’s lab website [Trevor Bedford]. We have modified a lot of the code, imported some features from [NBCLab] but the core codebase is still largely taken from the Drummond lab’s original repository. The code was openly shared on GitHub under the MIT license, so please feel free to adapt it for your own purposes. However, if you do use any of the code, please remember to cite the code to Dr. Drummond and to link back to [Dammond Lab].

The site started with [Jekyll Bootstrap], and was up and running in a weekend. The site is deployed using [GitHub Pages], which combines source-code control and hosting in a most pleasant way. Modify, test locally, push, and it's live.

Keeping with a major Jekyll Bootstrap idea, the site separates content and presentation. Presentation information is stored in a new theme, the `lab` theme, which may be useful to other research groups setting up sites.

By using [Sass] for stylesheets, the site gets virtually all the advantages of using [Less], while exploiting native Sass support in [GitHub Pages]. The site uses [Google Fonts] as well, primarily [Open Sans].

The site's source code is freely available on [GitHub]. All code is placed under the MIT license. You're welcome to borrow / repurpose code to build your own site, and if you do, I'd appreciate attribution and a link back [here](http://drummondlab.org/about.html).
