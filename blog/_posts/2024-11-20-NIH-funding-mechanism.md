NIH is one of the large funding bodies for biomedical research in the world. The grants that Professors get from the NIH are also one of the most pretigous, and competitive.

[NIH R01](https://grants.nih.gov/funding/activity-codes/R01) is one of the most common NIH funding mechanism that is employed for fundings labs and Principal Investigators (PI). However, there are more than [250 grant funding mechanism](https://grants.nih.gov/funding/activity-codes) that are employed by the NIH ! Needless to say that I do not understand all of them, and therefore this blog series.

In this multipart series we will be covering what NIH funding mechanisms can be used for **Research and Development** - and how they are simlar and different from each other.
