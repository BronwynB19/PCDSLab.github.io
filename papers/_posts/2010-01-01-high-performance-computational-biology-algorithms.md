# Abstract

Multiple Sequence s Alignment (MSA) of biological sequences is a fundamental problem in computational biology due to its critical significance in wide ranging applications including haplotype reconstruction, sequence homology, phylogenetic analysis, and prediction of evolutionary origins. The MSA problem is considered NP-hard and known heuristics for the problem do not scale well with increasing number of sequences. On the other hand, with the advent of new breed of fast sequencing techniques it is now possible to generate thousands of sequences very quickly. For rapid sequence analysis, it is therefore desirable to develop fast MSA algorithms that scale well with the increase in the dataset size. In this dissertation, we propose a novel domain decomposition based technique to solve the multiple sequence alignment problem on multiprocessing platforms. The domain decomposition based technique, in …
