# Abstract

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) regulate diverse physiological processes, and many human diseases are due to defects in GPCR signaling. To identify the dynamic response of a signaling network downstream from a prototypical Gs-coupled GPCR, the vasopressin V2 receptor, we have carried out multireplicate, quantitative phosphoproteomics with iTRAQ labeling at four time points following vasopressin exposure at a physiological concentration in cells isolated from rat kidney. A total of 12,167 phosphopeptides were identified from 2,783 proteins, with 273 changing significantly in abundance with vasopressin. Two-dimensional clustering of phosphopeptide time courses and Gene Ontology terms revealed that ligand binding to the V2 receptor affects more than simply the canonical cyclic adenosine monophosphate-protein kinase A and arrestin pathways under physiological conditions. The regulated …
