# Abstract

Investigation of physiological mechanisms at a cellular level often requires production of high-quality antibodies, frequently using synthetic peptides as immunogens. Here we describe a new, web-based software tool called NHLBI-AbDesigner that allows the user to visualize the information needed to choose optimal peptide sequences for peptide-directed antibody production (http://helixweb.nih.gov/AbDesigner/). The choice of an immunizing peptide is generally based on a need to optimize immunogenicity, antibody specificity, multispecies conservation, and robustness in the face of posttranslational modifications (PTMs). AbDesigner displays information relevant to these criteria as follows: 1) “Immunogenicity Score,” based on hydropathy and secondary structure prediction; 2) “Uniqueness Score,” a predictor of specificity of an antibody against all proteins expressed in the same species; 3) “Conservation Score …
