# Abstract

Biological information is growing at a rapid pace, making it difficult for individual investigators to be familiar with all information that is relevant to their own research. Computers are beginning to be used to extract and curate biological information; however, the complexity of human language used in research papers continues to be a critical barrier to full automation of knowledge extraction. Here, we report a manually curated knowledge base of vasopressin actions in renal epithelial cells that is designed to be readable either by humans or by computer programs using natural language processing algorithms. The knowledge base consists of three related databases accessible at https://helixweb.nih.gov/ESBL/TinyUrls/Vaso_portal.html. One of the component databases reports vasopressin actions on individual proteins expressed in renal epithelia, including effects on phosphorylation, protein abundances, protein …
