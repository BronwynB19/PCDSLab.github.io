# Abstract

Satavaptan (SR121463) is a vasopressin V2 receptor antagonist that has been shown to improve hyponatremia in patients with cirrhosis, congestive heart failure, and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis. While known to inhibit adenylyl cyclase-mediated accumulation of intracellular cyclic AMP and potentially recruit β-arrestin in kidney cell lines, very little is known regarding the signaling pathways that are affected by this drug. To this end, we carried out a global quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis of native rat inner medullary collecting duct cells pretreated with satavaptan or vehicle control followed by the V2 receptor agonist desmopressin (dDAVP) for 0.5, 2, 5, or 15 min. A total of 2,449 unique phosphopeptides from 1,160 proteins were identified. Phosphopeptides significantly changed by satavaptan included many of the same kinases [protein kinase A, phosphoinositide 3-kinase, mitogen-activated …
