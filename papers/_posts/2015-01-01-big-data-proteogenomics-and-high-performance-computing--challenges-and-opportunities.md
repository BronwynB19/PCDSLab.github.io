# Abstract

Proteogenomics is an emerging field of systems biology research at the intersection of proteomics and genomics. Two high-throughput technologies, Mass Spectrometry (MS) for proteomics and Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) machines for genomics are required to conduct proteogenomics studies. Independently both MS and NGS technologies are inflicted with data deluge which creates problems of storage, transfer, analysis and visualization. Integrating these big data sets (NGS+MS) for proteogenomics studies compounds all of the associated computational problems. Existing sequential algorithms for these proteogenomics datasets analysis are inadequate for big data and high performance computing (HPC) solutions are almost non-existent. The purpose of this paper is to introduce the big data problem of proteogenomics and the associated challenges in analyzing, storing and transferring these data sets …
