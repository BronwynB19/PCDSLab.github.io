# Abstract

We propose a Data Aware Communication Technique (DACT) that reduces energy consumption in Energy Harvesting Wireless Sensor Networks (EH-WSN). DACT takes advantage of the data correlation present in household EH-WSN applications to reduce communication overhead. It adapts its functionality according to correlations in data communicated over the EH-WSN and operates independently from spatial and temporal correlations without requiring location information. Our results show that DACT improves communication efficiency of sensor nodes and can help reduce idle energy consumption in an average-size home by up to 90 % as compared to spatial/temporal correlation-based communication techniques.
