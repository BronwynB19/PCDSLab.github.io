# Abstract

The revolution of smart devices has a significant and positive impact on the lives of many people, especially in regard to elements of healthcare. In part, this revolution is attributed to technological advances that enable individuals to wear and use medical devices to monitor their health activities, but remotely. Also, these smart, wearable medical devices assist health care providers in monitoring their patients remotely, thereby enabling physicians to respond quickly in the event of emergencies. An ancillary advantage is that health care costs will be reduced, another benefit that, when paired with prompt medical treatment, indicates significant advances in the contemporary management of health care. However, the competition among manufacturers of these medical devices creates a complexity of small and smart wearable devices such as ECG and EMG. This complexity results in other issues such as patient security …
