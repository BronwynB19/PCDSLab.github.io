# Abstract

In the age of Big Genomics Data, institutions such as the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) are challenged in their efforts to share volumes of data between researchers, a process that has been plagued by unreliable transfers and slow speeds. These occur due to throughput bottlenecks of traditional transfer technologies. Two factors that affect the efficiency of data transmission are the channel bandwidth and the amount of data. Increasing the bandwidth is one way to transmit data efficiently, but might not always be possible due to resource limitations. Another way to maximize channel utilization is by decreasing the bits needed for transmission of a dataset. Traditionally, transmission of big genomic data between two geographical locations is done using general-purpose protocols, such as hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) and file transfer protocol (FTP) secure. In this paper, we present a novel …
