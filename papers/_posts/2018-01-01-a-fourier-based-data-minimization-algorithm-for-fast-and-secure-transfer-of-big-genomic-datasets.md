# Abstract

DNA sequencing plays an important role in the bioinformatics research community. DNA sequencing is important to all organisms, especially to humans and from multiple perspectives. These include understanding the correlation of specific mutations that plays a significant role in increasing or decreasing the risks of developing a disease or condition, or finding the implications and connections between the genotype and the phenotype. Advancements in the high-throughput sequencing techniques, tools, and equipment, have helped to generate big genomic datasets due to the tremendous decrease in the DNA sequence costs. However, the advancements have posed great challenges to genomic data storage, analysis, and transfer. Accessing, manipulating, and sharing the generated big genomic datasets present major challenges in terms of time and size, as well as privacy. Data size plays an important role in …
