# Abstract

In the age of ever increasing data, faster and more efficient data processing algorithms are needed. Graphics Processing Units (GPU) are emerging as a cost-effective alternative architecture for high-end computing. The optimal design of GPU algorithms is a challenging task which requires thorough understanding of the high performance computing architecture as well as the algorithmic design. The steep learning curve needed for effective GPU-centric algorithm design and implementation requires considerable expertise, time, and resources. In this paper, we present GPU-DAEMON, a GPU Data Management, Algorithm Design and Optimization technique suitable for processing array based big omics data. Our proposed GPU algorithm design template outlines and provides generic methods to tackle critical bottlenecks which can be followed to implement high performance, scalable GPU algorithms for given big …
