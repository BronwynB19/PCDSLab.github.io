# Abstract

The Sparse Fast Fourier Transform (MIT-SFFT) is an algorithm to compute the discrete Fourier transform of a signal with a sublinear time complexity, i.e. algorithms with runtime complexity proportional to the sparsity level k, where k is the number of non-zero coefficients of the signal in the frequency domain. In this paper, we propose a highly scalable GPU-based parallel algorithm called GPU-SFFT for computing the SFFT of k-sparse signals. Our implementation of GPU-SFFT is based on parallel optimizations that leads to enormous speedups. These include carefully crafting parallel regions in the sequential MIT-SFFT code to exploit parallelism, and minimizing data movement between the CPU and the GPU. This allows us to exploit extreme parallelism for the CPU-GPU architectures and to maximize the number of concurrent threads executing instructions. Our experiments show that our designed CPU-GPU …
