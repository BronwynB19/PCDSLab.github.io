# Abstract

Methods and systems for compressing data, such as ion-mass information data in mass spectrometry spectra, to reduce index size are provided. Data in an index, such as fragment-ion data in a fragment-ion index, can be transformed for reduction of entropy and then encoded using a running counter technique to compress repetitive and redundant information in the index.
