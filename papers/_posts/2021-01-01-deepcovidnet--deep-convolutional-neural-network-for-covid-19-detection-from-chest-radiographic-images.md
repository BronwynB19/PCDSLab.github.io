# Abstract

The novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic that has infected millions of people causing millions of deaths around the world. Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) is the standard screening method for COVID-19 detection but it requires specific molecular-biology training. Moreover, the general workflow is difficult e.g. sample collection, processing time, and analysis expertise, etc. Chest radiographic image analysis can be a good alternative screening method that is faster, more efficient, and requires minimal clinical or molecular biology trained laboratory personnel. Early studies have shown that abnormalities on the chest radiographic images are likely to be the consequence of COVID-19 infection. In this study, we propose DeepCOVIDNet, a deep learning based COVID-19 detection model. Our proposed deep-learning model is a multiclass classifier that can …
