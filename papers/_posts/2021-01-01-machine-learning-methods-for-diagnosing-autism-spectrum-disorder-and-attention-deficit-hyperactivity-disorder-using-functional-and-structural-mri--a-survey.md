# Abstract

Here we summarize recent progress in machine learning model for diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Attention-deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). We outline and describe the machine-learning, especially deep-learning, techniques that are suitable for addressing research questions in this domain, pitfalls of the available methods, as well as future directions for the field. We envision a future where the diagnosis of ASD, ADHD, and other mental disorders is accomplished, and quantified using imaging techniques, such as MRI, and machine-learning models.
