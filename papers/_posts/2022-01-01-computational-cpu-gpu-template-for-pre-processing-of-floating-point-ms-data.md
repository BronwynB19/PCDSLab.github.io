# Abstract

The data from MS spectra is usually stored as short list of numbers. To process these spectra, more often than not, one has to “see” inside the data to make data pre- and post-processing decisions . Sorting, and searching of data for an array of number is one of the oldest problems in computer science. There has been significant effort in developing algorithms that can sort very large array .
