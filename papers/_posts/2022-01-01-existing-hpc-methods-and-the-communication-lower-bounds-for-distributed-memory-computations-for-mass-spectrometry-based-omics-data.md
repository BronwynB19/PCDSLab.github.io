# Abstract

Mass spectrometry (MS)-based omics data analysis requires substantial time and resources which has necessitated the need for high-performance computing (HPC) methods. Few parallel algorithms have been proposed, designed, and developed when the amount of data that needed to be processed was smaller in scale, i.e. only a few PTM were of interest and would satisfy when only a shorter theoretical database was needed for computations.
