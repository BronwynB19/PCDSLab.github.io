# Abstract

For the past 30 years, significant efforts were invested for the development of designing and implementing more efficient scoringScoring functions which included highly successful search enginesSearch-engines [, , , –]. Similar to other domains, numerical algorithms were developed for Mass Spectrometry (MS)-based peptidePeptide deduction and are designed and implemented by assuming number of arithmetic operationsArithmetic operations as the sole metric for efficiencyEfficiency.
