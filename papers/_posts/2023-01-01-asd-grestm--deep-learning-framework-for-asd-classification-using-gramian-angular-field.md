# Abstract

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous disorder in children, and the current clinical diagnosis is accomplished using behavioral, cognitive, developmental, and language metrics. These clinical metrics can be imperfect measures as they are subject to high test-retest variability, and are influenced by assessment factors such as environment, social structure, or comorbid disorders. Advances in neuroimaging coupled with machine-learning provides an opportunity to develop methods that are more quantifiable, and reliable than existing clinical techniques. In this paper, we design and develop a deep-learning model that operates on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, and can classify between ASD and neurotypical brains. We introduce a novel strategy to transform time-series data extracted from fMRI signals into Gramian Angular Field (GAF) while locking in the temporal and spatial …
