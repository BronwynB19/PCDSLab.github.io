# Abstract

The human brain has a complex network structure that is non-random and multiscale. It consists of subsystems coupled by a nonlinear dynamic, enabling it to produce complex responses to various external inputs and self-organize. To understand the physical structure and specific brain functions, it is essential to comprehend the connectivity of the hundreds of billions of neurons in the human brain. Functional connectivity (FC) in modern neuroscience is the statistical temporal dependencies between neuronal activation events occurring in spatially separated brain regions. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) is a non-invasive imaging technique widely used in neuroscience to understand the functional connectivity of the human brain. The studies presented in this dissertation were based on the models and methods from network neuroscience, which is an active area of research developed in the last three decades. These methods were used to model and analyze the functional human brain networks in a multi-site rs-fMRI data framework.
