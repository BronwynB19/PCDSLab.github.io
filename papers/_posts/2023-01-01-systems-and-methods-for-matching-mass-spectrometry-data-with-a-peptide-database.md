# Abstract

Systems, architectures, devices, and methods for matching experimentally acquired mass spectrometry data with a peptide database are provided. The system architecture can include a host central processing unit (CPU) system, a bridge connecting the CPU system with a core control register (or registers), a plurality of processing elements (PEs), and a bus arbiter. The PEs can execute the computations in a parallel and asynchronous manner. The bus arbiter can be a first-come first-serve (FCFS)-based bus arbiter (ie, can utilize an FCFS-based arbitration scheme).
