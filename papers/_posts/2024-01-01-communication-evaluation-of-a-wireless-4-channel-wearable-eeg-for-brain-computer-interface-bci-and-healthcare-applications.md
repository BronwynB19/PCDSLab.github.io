# Abstract

This paper evaluates the communication performance of a wearable electroencephalography (EEG) headband for brain-computer interface (BCI) and healthcare applications. Our study is motivated by the application of EEG sensors to epileptic seizure prediction using short duration segments. Using packet delivery ratio (PDR) as the metric, we show that shorter segments suffer from lower PDR which can have catastrophic implications for health/BCI applications based on predictive modeling.
