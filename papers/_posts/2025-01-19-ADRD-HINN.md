# Abstract

Detecting declines in cognitive function is a critical global health concern, highlighting the need for timely identification to implement effective intervention strategies. This study investigates the potential of blood‐based biomarkers as accurate and non‐invasive measures of cognitive function. We developed a novel deep learning architecture that integrates multi‐omics data by considering their relationship. Specifically, we integrated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), gene expression, and DNA methylation data to predict cognitive test scores.
