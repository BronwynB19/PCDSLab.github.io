# Abstract

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by memory loss and cognitive decline. Traditional diagnostic methods, mainly based on cognitive, memory, and behavioral tests, have limitations, particularly in the early detection of AD. Structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) has emerged as a key tool in understanding the brain changes associated with AD, focusing particularly on alterations in gray matter (GM). However, the complexity of brain changes in AD requires sophisticated analysis methods. In recent years, machine learning (ML) models have shown great potential in interpreting complex neuroimaging data. These models can detect intricate patterns in neuroimaging data, making them invaluable in enhancing the diagnostic accuracy and early AD diagnosis. Therefore, combining the neuroimaging data with ML models presents a promising direction in improving the early‐diagnosis and understanding of AD.
