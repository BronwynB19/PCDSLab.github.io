# Abstract

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurogenerative disease that affect millions worldwide with no effective treatment. Several studies have been conducted to decipher to genomic underpinnings of AD. Due to its complex nature, many genes have been found to be associated with AD. Despite these findings, the pathophysiology of the disease is still elusive. In this study, we integrated multimodal gene and phenotype datasets of AD using network biology methods to prioritize potential AD-related genes.
