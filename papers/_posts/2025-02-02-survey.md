# Abstract

Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a widespread neurodegenerative disease with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) acting as an interim phase between normal cognitive state and AD. The irreversible nature of AD and the difficulty in early prediction present significant challenges for patients, caregivers, and the healthcare sector. Deep learning (DL) methods such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) have been utilized to analyze Electronic Health Records (EHR) to model disease progression and predict diagnosis. However, these models do not address some inherent irregularities in EHR data such as irregular time intervals between clinical visits. Furthermore, most DL models are not interpretable. To address these issues, we developed a novel DL architecture called Time-Aware RNN (TA-RNN) to predict MCI to AD conversion at the next clinical visit.
