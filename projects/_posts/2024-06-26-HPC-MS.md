## Abstract

This project will design and develop high-performance computational frameworks which will enable effective analysis of omics data produced from mass spectrometry machines. The proposed high-performance computing (HPC) techniques will enable identification of novel peptides/proteins, and insights into microbiome communities and their effects on human health, agriculture, and environments. 

 The project will focus on the design and development of: (1) CPU-GPU based method for processing of large-scale MS-based omics with communication-avoiding parallel pipelines; (2) methods for exploiting multiple GPUs on single node which is extended to memory-distributed CPU-GPU nodes on supercomputing machines; (3) hardware/software co-designs using CPU-FPGA architectures. This computational infrastructure will allow scientists to use large heterogeneous supercomputers, and the development of hardware/software designs will enable us to incorporate semiconductor designs directly on mass spectrometry machines. The development of such semiconductors designed for end-use application (of MS omics data) will preserve US global economic competitiveness, and will accelerate urgently needed personalized nutrition studies, human gut microbiome research, and cancer therapeutics studies.

## Methods
