**Short Bio**

Dr. Fahad Saeed is Full Professor and Director of Graduate Studies in the Knight Foundation [School of Computing and Information Sciences](https://www.cis.fiu.edu/) at [Florida International University (FIU)](https://www.fiu.edu/), Miami FL. He received his PhD in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.uic.edu/), [University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC)](http://www.uic.edu/uic/) in 2010. He was trained as a Post-Doctoral Fellow and Research Fellow in the [Systems Biology Center](https://esbl.nhlbi.nih.gov/) at [National Institutes of Health (NIH)](https://www.nih.gov/), Bethesda MD from Aug 2010 to January 2014 respectively, under the supervision of Mark Knepper. Prior to joining FIU, Prof. Saeed was a tenure-track Assistant Professor in the [Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering](https://wmich.edu/ece/) and [Department of Computer Science](http://wmich.edu/cs/) at [Western Michigan University (WMU)](http://wmich.edu/), Kalamazoo Michigan since Jan 2014. He was tenured and promoted to the rank of Associate Professor at WMU in August 2018. He has served as a visiting scientist in world-renowned prestigious institutions such as [Department of Bio-Systems Science and Engineering (D-BSSE)](http://www.bsse.ethz.ch/), [ETH Zurich](http://www.ethz.ch/index_EN), [Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (SIB)](http://www.isb-sib.ch/) and  [Epithelial Systems Biology Laboratory (ESBL)](https://esbl.nhlbi.nih.gov/) at [National Institutes of Health (NIH)](http://www.nih.gov/) Bethesda, Maryland.

Dr. Saeed's research interests are at the intersection of machine-learning, high performance computing and real-world applications, especially in computational biology. He is the director of [Precision Computational Health and Biomedical Data Science Lab (Saeed Lab)](https://pcdslab.github.io/) at FIU. His lab develops machine-learning models, combined with high-performance computing, and data science approaches, to study the functional genomics (proteomics), and organization of the human brain and its function in the context of prediction, diagnosis and characterization of biomarkers specific to disorders such as epilepsy, ADHD, Autism, and Alzheimerâ€™s. His research has been funded by NVIDIA, Intel/Altera, Xilinx, National Science Foundation (NSF) and National Institutes of Health (NIH) including the highly prestigious NSF CAREER, and NIH R01 (and R01-equivalent R35 MIRA) grants. More information about his lab research activities can be found at <https://pcdslab.github.io/>.
